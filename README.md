<summary # File Design Structure </summary>
  
This document outlines the directory structure and design principles for the NexusPay monorepo. The goal is to create a logical, scalable, and maintainable codebase that supports our microservices architecture.

1. Top-Level Directory Structure
The root of the repository will be organized into high-level domains: backend services, the frontend application, shared libraries, and project-wide configuration.
```
nexus-pay/
├── backend/                  # Contains all Java-based backend microservices
├── frontend/                 # The Vite + React + TypeScript web application
├── libs/                     # Shared libraries used by multiple services
├── infra/                    # Infrastructure-as-Code (Docker, Terraform)
├── docs/                     # Project documentation (API specs, architecture)
└── .github/                  # CI/CD workflows and repository templates
```
2. Backend Services (/backend)
Our Java backend will be composed of several independent microservices, each following a standard Spring Boot project structure. This modularity allows each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
```
backend/
├── nexus-api-gateway/        # (Spring Cloud Gateway) - The single entry point for all API traffic. Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
│
├── nexus-billing-service/    # The core billing engine. Manages subscriptions, plans, invoices, and payment processing logic.
│   └── src/main/java/com/nexuspay/billing/
│       ├── controller/       # REST API endpoints
│       ├── service/          # Business logic
│       ├── model/            # JPA entities (Invoice, Subscription)
│       ├── repository/       # Spring Data JPA repositories
│       └── integration/      # Clients for payment gateways (Stripe)
│
├── nexus-metering-service/   # Handles real-time usage event ingestion from Kafka.
│   └── src/main/java/com/nexuspay/metering/
│       ├── consumer/         # Kafka consumers
│       ├── service/          # Event processing and aggregation logic
│       └── model/            # Data models for usage events
│
├── nexus-identity-service/   # Manages tenants, users, roles, and permissions.
│   └── src/main/java/com/nexuspay/identity/
│       ├── controller/       # User and tenant management APIs
│       ├── service/          # Authentication and authorization logic
│       └── model/            # Tenant and User entities
│
├── nexus-ml-service/         # Hosts the ML models for adaptive intelligence.
│   └── src/main/java/com/nexuspay/ml/
│       ├── controller/       # APIs to get forecasts or anomaly reports
│       └── service/          # Logic for loading and running ML models
│
└── pom.xml                   # Parent Maven file to manage common dependencies
```
3. Frontend Application (/frontend)
The frontend is a modern Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. The structure is organized by feature and function for clarity.
```
frontend/
├── public/                   # Static assets like images and fonts
├── src/
│   ├── assets/               # CSS, images, and other static files
│   ├── components/           # Reusable UI components (Button, Modal, Chart)
│   │   └── ui/               # Generic, unstyled base components
│   ├── features/             # Components and logic for specific features
│   │   ├── dashboard/
│   │   ├── subscriptions/
│   │   └── invoices/
│   ├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks (e.g., useAuth, useApi)
│   ├── pages/                # Top-level page components
│   ├── services/             # API client logic for communicating with the backend
│   ├── types/                # TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
│   ├── App.tsx               # Main application component
│   └── main.tsx              # Application entry point
│
├── package.json              # Project dependencies and scripts
└── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript compiler configuration
```
4. Shared Libraries & Infrastructure


/libs/java-common/: A shared Java library (packaged as a JAR) containing common code used by multiple backend services, such as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), custom exceptions, and utility classes. This prevents code duplication.

/infra/: Contains all Infrastructure-as-Code files.

docker-compose.yml: For setting up a complete local development environment (PostgreSQL, Kafka, etc.) with a single command.

terraform/: Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, databases) on AWS, GCP, or Azure.

/docs/: Centralized project documentation.


</details>

api/: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for all backend microservices.

architecture.md: Detailed diagrams and explanations of the system architecture.

This structured, modular design will ensure that as NexusPay grows in complexity, the codebase remains clean, understandable, and easy for the team to work on collaboratively.

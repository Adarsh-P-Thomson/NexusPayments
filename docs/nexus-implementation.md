## Getting Started Today

### Prerequisites
1. **Java 21+** - Download from [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/)
2. **Node.js 18+** - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
3. **Docker & Docker Compose** - Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)
4. **Maven 3.8+** - Download from [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/)
5. **Git** - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone and Initialize Repository
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-P-Thomson/NexusPayments.git
cd NexusPayments

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p backend/nexus-api-gateway
mkdir -p backend/nexus-billing-service
mkdir -p backend/nexus-metering-service
mkdir -p backend/nexus-identity-service
mkdir -p backend/nexus-ml-service
mkdir -p frontend
mkdir -p libs/java-common
mkdir -p infra/{terraform,scripts,monitoring}
mkdir -p docs/{api,architecture}
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

#### 2. Create Parent POM
Create `backend/pom.xml` with the parent POM configuration provided in the documentation above.

#### 3. Start Infrastructure Services
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev-start.sh
```

#### 4. Create First Microservice (Identity Service)
```bash
cd backend/nexus-identity-service

# Create Maven project structure
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DgroupId=com.nexuspay.identity \
    -DartifactId=nexus-identity-service \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
    -DinteractiveMode=false

# Update pom.xml to use parent and Spring Boot
# Create basic Spring Boot application
```

#### 5. Set Up Frontend
```bash
cd frontend

# Initialize Vite React TypeScript project
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install additional packages
npm install react-router-dom @tanstack/react-query recharts tailwindcss

# Initialize Tailwind CSS
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

#### 6. Development Workflow
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev-start.sh

# Terminal 2: Start backend services (as they are built)
./scripts/start-backend.sh

# Terminal 3: Start frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Terminal 4: Monitor logs
tail -f logs/*.log
```

### Development Best Practices

#### 1. Code Organization
- Use feature-based organization for frontend
- Follow domain-driven design for backend
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Use consistent naming conventions

#### 2. Testing Strategy
```bash
# Backend testing
mvn test                           # Unit tests
mvn verify                        # Integration tests
mvn test -Dgroups=performance     # Performance tests

# Frontend testing
npm test                          # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e                  # End-to-end tests
npm run test:coverage             # Coverage report
```

#### 3. Database Migrations
```bash
# Run migrations
mvn flyway:migrate -pl nexus-billing-service

# Create new migration
mvn flyway:migrate -pl nexus-billing-service \
  -Dflyway.locations=filesystem:src/main/resources/db/migration
```

#### 4. Monitoring & Debugging
- Use Grafana dashboards for system monitoring
- Leverage Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Monitor Kafka topics with Kafka UI
- Use application logs for debugging

### Key Implementation Tips

#### 1. Multi-Tenancy
- Always filter by `tenantId` in database queries
- Use JPA `@Where` annotations for automatic filtering
- Implement tenant context in security layer
- Test tenant isolation thoroughly

#### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Design events to be idempotent
- Include correlation IDs for tracing
- Handle event ordering carefully
- Implement event replay capabilities

#### 3. Performance Considerations
- Use database connection pooling
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use async processing for non-critical operations
- Monitor and optimize database queries

#### 4. Security
- Always validate input data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regularly update dependencies

This roadmap provides a clear path to building the complete NexusPay platform. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation while adding increasingly sophisticated features. The key is to start simple and iterate, testing thoroughly at each stage.
